Make Sync Your Own

This here section tells ya how to make Cirrus Sync do what *you* want. It's like ! a painting ! but with files and stuff.Error Messages ! Making Them Yourz

Sometimes stuff goes wrong, ! right ? And when it does, Cirrus Sync tells ya ! but what if you wanna tell it in your own words ! ? Here's how.

**Problem:** Standard error messages too boring, ! no fun !

**Solution:**

1. Find the 
   ```
   error_messages.json
   ```
    file. It's probably somewhere in the 
   ```
   config
   ```
    folder. ! If you can't find it ? You're not lookin' hard enough.
2. Open it up ! with a text editor, duh.
3. Change the messages to whatever your heart desires. Like, for 
   ```
   E001 - Authentication Failed
   ```
    you could write: ! "Whoopsie ! You typed that in wrong ! Try again, sleepyhead. !"
4. Save the file. ! And then restart Cirrus Sync for the changes to take effect ! Duh.

**Example !!**

```json
{
  "E001": "Whoopsie ! You typed that in wrong ! Try again, sleepyhead. !",
  "E002": "Lost connection to the cloud ! Maybe check your Wi-Fi, genius. !"
}
```

AI Magic !! Morphing Files !!

This is the super cool part !! You can make Cirrus Sync use ! AI ! to change your files while they sync. It's like !! magic !!

**Problem:** Files are boring !! Need more pizzazz !!

**Solution:**

1. Go to 
   ```
   Settings > AI Enhancements > File Morphing
   ```
   . ! It's there ! If it's not ! you need a newer version.
2. Enable "Morph on Upload" or "Morph on Download". Or both !! Go wild.
3. Choose your "AI Model" ! Like, "Groot" for plant-based transformations, or "Optimus Prime" for making your documents into vehicles. ! ( ! Not really ! )
4. Configure "Morphing Rules". This is where you tell the AI what to do. ! It's a bit complicated, so pay attention.

**Morphing Rules Example !!**

Let's say you wanna make all your `jpg` files look like paintings when you upload them.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "extension": "jpg",
      "action": "transform_style",
      "parameters": {
        "style": "oil_painting",
        "intensity": 0.8
      },
      "direction": "upload"
    },
    {
      "extension": "txt",
      "action": "summarize_long_text",
      "parameters": {
        "length": "short"
      },
      "direction": "download"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important Notes !!**

- AI morphing uses lots of !! CPU and RAM !! So if your computer sounds like a jet engine ? That's why.
- Don't blame us if the AI makes your cat pictures look like !! aliens !! It's experimental, ya know ?
- Always test this stuff on unimportant files first !! You don't want your super important documents to turn into !! unreadable gibberish !! Do ya ?

This is just the start of your sync customization journey !! Go forth and be awesome !!
