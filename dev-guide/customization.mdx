# Customize Cirrus Sync

Cirrus Sync provides customization options to tailor the synchronization experience to your specific needs. You can customize error messages and configure AI-powered file transformations.

## Prerequisites

Before customizing Cirrus Sync, ensure you have:

- Administrative access to your Cirrus Sync installation
- A text editor for configuration files
- Basic understanding of JSON file format

## Customize error messages

You can modify error messages to match your organization's tone or provide more specific guidance to users.

### Locate the configuration file

1. Navigate to your Cirrus Sync installation directory
2. Open the `config` folder
3. Find the `error_messages.json` file

### Modify error messages

1. Open `error_messages.json` in a text editor
2. Update the message text for specific error codes
3. Save the file
4. Restart Cirrus Sync to apply changes

#### Example configuration

```json
{
  "E001": "Authentication failed. Please verify your credentials and try again.",
  "E002": "Connection lost. Check your network connection and retry.",
  "E003": "File access denied. Ensure you have proper permissions for this file."
}
```

### Common error codes

| Code | Default message | When it occurs |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| E001 | Authentication Failed | Invalid login credentials |
| E002 | Connection Error | Network connectivity issues |
| E003 | Permission Denied | Insufficient file permissions |

## Configure AI file transformations

AI file morphing allows you to automatically transform files during synchronization using machine learning models.

### Enable AI transformations

1. Open Cirrus Sync settings
2. Navigate to **AI Enhancements** > **File Morphing**
3. Enable one or both options:
   - **Morph on Upload**: Transform files when uploading to cloud storage
   - **Morph on Download**: Transform files when downloading from cloud storage

### Select AI models

Choose from available AI models based on your transformation needs:

- **Standard**: General-purpose transformations
- **Creative**: Artistic and stylistic modifications
- **Productivity**: Document optimization and summarization

### Configure transformation rules

Create rules to specify which files to transform and how to transform them.

#### Rule structure

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "extension": "file_extension",
      "action": "transformation_type",
      "parameters": {
        "setting": "value"
      },
      "direction": "upload_or_download"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example transformation rules

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "extension": "jpg",
      "action": "transform_style",
      "parameters": {
        "style": "oil_painting",
        "intensity": 0.8
      },
      "direction": "upload"
    },
    {
      "extension": "txt",
      "action": "summarize_text",
      "parameters": {
        "max_length": 500,
        "preserve_key_points": true
      },
      "direction": "download"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Available transformation actions

| Action | Description | Supported file types |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| `transform_style` | Apply artistic styles to images | jpg, png, gif |
| `summarize_text` | Create text summaries | txt, md, docx |
| `optimize_image` | Compress and optimize images | jpg, png, webp |
| `convert_format` | Convert between file formats | Various |

## Performance considerations

AI transformations require significant computational resources:

- **CPU usage**: High during transformation processes
- **Memory requirements**: 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Processing time**: Varies by file size and transformation complexity

## Best practices

Follow these recommendations when using customization features:

### Testing

- Test customizations on non-critical files first
- Create backups before applying transformations
- Monitor system performance during AI processing

### Error message guidelines

- Use clear, actionable language
- Provide specific next steps when possible
- Maintain consistent tone across all messages
- Include relevant error codes for troubleshooting

### AI transformation guidelines

- Start with low-intensity settings
- Review transformed files before relying on them
- Consider bandwidth implications for large files
- Document your transformation rules for team members

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**Error messages not updating**
- Verify the JSON syntax is correct
- Ensure Cirrus Sync was restarted after changes
- Check file permissions on the configuration file

**AI transformations not working**
- Confirm your system meets minimum requirements
- Verify the AI model is properly installed
- Check transformation rule syntax

**Performance issues**
- Reduce transformation intensity settings
- Limit concurrent transformations
- Monitor system resources during processing

## Next steps

After customizing Cirrus Sync:

- Monitor system performance and user feedback
- Regularly review and update error messages
- Experiment with different AI transformation settings
- Document your customizations for team reference
