# Customization guide

Cirrus Sync offers extensive customization options to tailor synchronization behavior to your specific requirements. This comprehensive guide covers advanced configuration techniques, custom integrations, and extensibility patterns for developers.

## How do I customize sync behavior?

Cirrus Sync offers multiple levels of customization to adapt to your specific workflow requirements:

### Sync patterns

Choose the synchronization pattern that best fits your workflow:

- **Bidirectional sync** - Changes flow in both directions between local and remote locations
- **Upload-only sync** - Local changes push to remote, but remote changes are ignored
- **Download-only sync** - Remote changes pull locally, but local changes don't upload
- **Mirror sync** - Local directory becomes an exact copy of the remote directory

**Configuration example:**
```json
{
  "syncPattern": "bidirectional",
  "conflictResolution": "manual"
}
```

### File filtering

Control which files participate in synchronization:

- **Include/exclude patterns** - Use glob patterns to specify which files to sync
- **File size limits** - Set maximum file sizes for synchronization (e.g., 100MB limit)
- **File type restrictions** - Limit sync to specific file extensions (.pdf, .docx, .jpg)
- **Hidden file handling** - Choose whether to sync hidden files and system files

**Example filter configuration:**
```json
{
  "filters": {
    "include": ["*.pdf", "*.docx", "documents/**"],
    "exclude": ["*.tmp", "node_modules/**", ".git/**"],
    "maxFileSize": "100MB",
    "syncHiddenFiles": false
  }
}
```

### Conflict resolution strategies

Define how to handle file conflicts automatically:

- **Manual resolution** - Prompt user to choose which version to keep
- **Latest wins** - Automatically use the most recently modified version
- **Local wins** - Always prefer the local version during conflicts
- **Remote wins** - Always prefer the remote version during conflicts

## What are custom sync rules?

Custom sync rules allow you to define sophisticated logic for how files are synchronized based on various criteria:

### File-based rules

Target specific files using these criteria:

- **Path matching** - Apply rules based on file paths using wildcards and regex patterns
- **Extension filtering** - Target specific file types for different sync behaviors
- **Size thresholds** - Handle large files differently than small files (e.g., >50MB files upload during off-hours)
- **Date-based rules** - Sync files based on creation or modification dates

**Example rule configuration:**
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "Large file handling",
      "condition": "fileSize > 50MB",
      "action": "scheduleOffHours",
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Image optimization",
      "condition": "extension in ['.jpg', '.png', '.gif']",
      "action": "compress",
      "settings": {"quality": 85}
    }
  ]
}
```

### Content-based rules

Apply rules based on file content and metadata:

- **Metadata filtering** - Use file metadata to determine sync behavior
- **Content scanning** - Apply rules based on file content analysis
- **Checksum validation** - Ensure file integrity during synchronization
- **Version detection** - Handle versioned files with custom logic

### Advanced rule conditions

Create complex rule logic:

- **Conditional logic** - Combine multiple criteria with AND/OR operators
- **Time-based triggers** - Execute rules at specific times or intervals
- **User context** - Apply different rules based on the current user
- **System state** - Modify behavior based on network conditions or system resources

### Rule priority and inheritance

Manage rule execution order:

- **Rule ordering** - Define execution priority for overlapping rules (1 = highest priority)
- **Inheritance patterns** - Apply parent directory rules to subdirectories
- **Override mechanisms** - Allow specific rules to override general ones
- **Conflict resolution** - Handle situations where multiple rules apply

## How can I create custom integrations?

Cirrus Sync provides multiple integration points to extend functionality and connect with external systems:

### API integrations
- **REST API endpoints** - Full programmatic access to sync operations and configuration
- **Webhook notifications** - Real-time events for sync status changes and file operations
- **GraphQL interface** - Flexible querying for complex data relationships
- **Batch operations** - Efficient handling of bulk sync operations

### Plugin architecture
- **Pre-sync hooks** - Execute custom logic before synchronization begins
- **Post-sync hooks** - Perform actions after sync completion
- **File processors** - Transform files during the sync process
- **Custom providers** - Add support for additional cloud storage services

### Event-driven customization
- **File change events** - React to specific file modifications or additions
- **Sync lifecycle events** - Hook into different phases of the synchronization process
- **Error handling events** - Custom logic for handling sync failures and retries
- **User interaction events** - Respond to user actions and preferences

### Configuration examples

**Custom webhook integration:**
```json
{
  "webhooks": {
    "syncComplete": "https://your-app.com/api/sync-complete",
    "syncError": "https://your-app.com/api/sync-error",
    "fileConflict": "https://your-app.com/api/file-conflict"
  }
}
```

**Plugin configuration:**
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "imageProcessor": {
      "enabled": true,
      "resizeImages": true,
      "maxWidth": 1920,
      "quality": 85
    },
    "documentConverter": {
      "enabled": true,
      "convertToPDF": ["docx", "odt"],
      "preserveOriginal": true
    }
  }
}
```

## What performance optimizations are available?

Cirrus Sync offers several performance optimization options to ensure efficient synchronization:

### Bandwidth management

Control network usage to optimize sync performance:

- **Upload/download limits** - Set maximum bandwidth usage (e.g., 10 Mbps during business hours)
- **Adaptive throttling** - Automatically adjust sync speed based on network conditions
- **Priority queuing** - Prioritize critical files over less important ones
- **Scheduled syncing** - Perform large file transfers during off-peak hours (e.g., 2-6 AM)

**Example bandwidth configuration:**
```json
{
  "bandwidth": {
    "maxUpload": "10Mbps",
    "maxDownload": "20Mbps",
    "adaptiveThrottling": true,
    "schedule": {
      "offPeakHours": "02:00-06:00",
      "offPeakBandwidth": "unlimited"
    }
  }
}
```

### Caching strategies

Improve sync efficiency with intelligent caching:

- **Local metadata cache** - Store file information locally to reduce API calls by 80%
- **Content-based deduplication** - Avoid uploading identical files multiple times
- **Delta synchronization** - Only sync changed portions of files (saves 60-90% bandwidth)
- **Predictive prefetching** - Pre-download files likely to be accessed soon

### Parallel processing

Maximize throughput with concurrent operations:

- **Concurrent transfers** - Upload/download multiple files simultaneously (default: 5 concurrent)
- **Thread pool optimization** - Efficiently manage system resources
- **Batch operations** - Group small operations for better efficiency
- **Asynchronous processing** - Non-blocking operations for better responsiveness

### Storage optimization

Reduce storage requirements and transfer times:

- **Compression algorithms** - Reduce file sizes during transfer (up to 70% reduction)
- **Smart chunking** - Break large files into optimal-sized pieces (default: 8MB chunks)
- **Temporary file management** - Efficiently handle intermediate files
- **Cleanup automation** - Remove unnecessary temporary and cache files daily

## How do I implement custom security policies?

Cirrus Sync provides comprehensive security customization options to meet enterprise and compliance requirements:

### Access control

Define granular permissions for users and groups:

- **Role-based permissions** - Define user roles with specific sync capabilities (admin, editor, viewer)
- **Directory-level access** - Control which folders users can sync (e.g., HR folder restricted to HR team)
- **File-level restrictions** - Prevent syncing of sensitive file types (.key, .pem, .p12 files)
- **Time-based access** - Limit sync operations to business hours (9 AM - 6 PM)

**Example access control configuration:**
```json
{
  "accessControl": {
    "roles": {
      "editor": {
        "permissions": ["read", "write", "sync"],
        "directories": ["/shared", "/projects"],
        "excludeFileTypes": [".key", ".pem", ".p12"]
      },
      "viewer": {
        "permissions": ["read"],
        "directories": ["/shared"],
        "timeRestrictions": "09:00-18:00"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Encryption options

Protect data with enterprise-grade encryption:

- **Client-side encryption** - Encrypt files before uploading (AES-256 encryption)
- **Custom encryption keys** - Use your own encryption keys for maximum security
- **Key rotation policies** - Automatically rotate encryption keys every 90 days
