# Customization guide

Cirrus Sync provides extensive customization options to tailor the synchronization experience to your specific needs. This guide covers advanced configuration techniques, custom integrations, and extensibility patterns for developers.

## How do I customize sync behavior?

Cirrus Sync offers multiple levels of customization to adapt to your specific workflow requirements:

### Sync patterns
- **Bidirectional sync** - Changes flow in both directions between local and remote
- **Upload-only sync** - Local changes are pushed to remote, but remote changes are ignored
- **Download-only sync** - Remote changes are pulled locally, but local changes are not uploaded
- **Mirror sync** - Local directory becomes an exact copy of the remote directory

### File filtering
- **Include/exclude patterns** - Use glob patterns to specify which files to sync
- **File size limits** - Set maximum file sizes for synchronization
- **File type restrictions** - Limit sync to specific file extensions
- **Hidden file handling** - Choose whether to sync hidden files and system files

### Conflict resolution strategies
- **Manual resolution** - Prompt user to choose which version to keep
- **Latest wins** - Automatically use the most recently modified version
- **Local wins** - Always prefer the local version during conflicts
- **Remote wins** - Always prefer the remote version during conflicts

## What are custom sync rules?

Custom sync rules allow you to define sophisticated logic for how files are synchronized based on various criteria:

### File-based rules
- **Path matching** - Apply rules based on file paths using wildcards and regex patterns
- **Extension filtering** - Target specific file types for different sync behaviors
- **Size thresholds** - Handle large files differently than small files
- **Date-based rules** - Sync files based on creation or modification dates

### Content-based rules
- **Metadata filtering** - Use file metadata to determine sync behavior
- **Content scanning** - Apply rules based on file content analysis
- **Checksum validation** - Ensure file integrity during synchronization
- **Version detection** - Handle versioned files with custom logic

### Advanced rule conditions
- **Conditional logic** - Combine multiple criteria with AND/OR operators
- **Time-based triggers** - Execute rules at specific times or intervals
- **User context** - Apply different rules based on the current user
- **System state** - Modify behavior based on network conditions or system resources

### Rule priority and inheritance
- **Rule ordering** - Define execution priority for overlapping rules
- **Inheritance patterns** - Apply parent directory rules to subdirectories
- **Override mechanisms** - Allow specific rules to override general ones
- **Conflict resolution** - Handle situations where multiple rules apply

## How can I create custom integrations?

Cirrus Sync provides multiple integration points to extend functionality and connect with external systems:

### API integrations
- **REST API endpoints** - Full programmatic access to sync operations and configuration
- **Webhook notifications** - Real-time events for sync status changes and file operations
- **GraphQL interface** - Flexible querying for complex data relationships
- **Batch operations** - Efficient handling of bulk sync operations

### Plugin architecture
- **Pre-sync hooks** - Execute custom logic before synchronization begins
- **Post-sync hooks** - Perform actions after sync completion
- **File processors** - Transform files during the sync process
- **Custom providers** - Add support for additional cloud storage services

### Event-driven customization
- **File change events** - React to specific file modifications or additions
- **Sync lifecycle events** - Hook into different phases of the synchronization process
- **Error handling events** - Custom logic for handling sync failures and retries
- **User interaction events** - Respond to user actions and preferences

### Configuration examples

**Custom webhook integration:**
```json
{
  "webhooks": {
    "syncComplete": "https://your-app.com/api/sync-complete",
    "syncError": "https://your-app.com/api/sync-error",
    "fileConflict": "https://your-app.com/api/file-conflict"
  }
}
```

**Plugin configuration:**
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "imageProcessor": {
      "enabled": true,
      "resizeImages": true,
      "maxWidth": 1920,
      "quality": 85
    },
    "documentConverter": {
      "enabled": true,
      "convertToPDF": ["docx", "odt"],
      "preserveOriginal": true
    }
  }
}
```

## What performance optimizations are available?

Cirrus Sync offers several performance optimization options to ensure efficient synchronization:

### Bandwidth management
- **Upload/download limits** - Set maximum bandwidth usage for sync operations
- **Adaptive throttling** - Automatically adjust sync speed based on network conditions
- **Priority queuing** - Prioritize certain files or operations over others
- **Scheduled syncing** - Perform intensive sync operations during off-peak hours

### Caching strategies
- **Local metadata cache** - Store file information locally to reduce API calls
- **Content-based deduplication** - Avoid uploading identical files multiple times
- **Delta synchronization** - Only sync changed portions of files when possible
- **Predictive prefetching** - Pre-download files likely to be accessed soon

### Parallel processing
- **Concurrent transfers** - Upload/download multiple files simultaneously
- **Thread pool optimization** - Efficiently manage system resources
- **Batch operations** - Group small operations for better efficiency
- **Asynchronous processing** - Non-blocking operations for better responsiveness

### Storage optimization
- **Compression algorithms** - Reduce file sizes during transfer
- **Smart chunking** - Break large files into optimal-sized pieces
- **Temporary file management** - Efficiently handle intermediate files
- **Cleanup automation** - Remove unnecessary temporary and cache files

## How do I implement custom security policies?

Cirrus Sync provides comprehensive security customization options to meet enterprise and compliance requirements:

### Access control
- **Role-based permissions** - Define user roles with specific sync capabilities
- **Directory-level access** - Control which folders users can sync
- **File-level restrictions** - Prevent syncing of sensitive file types
- **Time-based access** - Limit sync operations to specific time windows

### Encryption options
- **Client-side encryption** - Encrypt files before uploading to cloud storage
- **Custom encryption keys** - Use your own encryption keys for maximum security
- **Key rotation policies** - Automatically rotate encryption keys on schedule
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** - Ensure service providers cannot access your data

### Audit and compliance
- **Activity logging** - Comprehensive logs of all sync operations and user actions
- **Compliance reporting** - Generate reports for regulatory requirements
- **Data retention policies** - Automatically manage file lifecycle and deletion
- **Forensic capabilities** - Detailed tracking for security investigations

### Network security
- **VPN integration** - Require VPN connection for sync operations
- **IP whitelisting** - Restrict sync access to specific IP addresses or ranges
- **Certificate pinning** - Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Custom SSL certificates** - Use your organization's SSL certificates

## What are the best practices for customization?

Follow these guidelines to ensure successful Cirrus Sync customization:

### Configuration management
- **Version control** - Track configuration changes using version control systems
- **Environment separation** - Use different configurations for development, staging, and production
- **Backup strategies** - Regularly backup configuration files and custom rules
- **Documentation** - Document all customizations and their business rationale

### Performance considerations
- **Resource monitoring** - Monitor system resources during sync operations

- **Fallback mechanisms** - Implement fallback options for critical customizations
- **Regular optimization** - Periodically review and optimize custom rules and integrations

### Security best practices
- **Principle of least privilege** - Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Regular security reviews** - Audit customizations for security vulnerabilities
- **Secure credential storage** - Use secure methods to store API keys and passwords
- **Update management** - Keep custom integrations updated with security patches

### Maintenance and support
