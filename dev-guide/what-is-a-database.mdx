# Customization guide

Cirrus Sync provides extensive customization options to tailor the synchronization experience to your specific needs. This guide covers advanced configuration techniques, custom integrations, and extensibility patterns for developers.

## How do I customize sync behavior?

Cirrus Sync offers multiple levels of customization to adapt to your specific workflow requirements:

### Sync patterns
- **Bidirectional sync** - Changes flow in both directions between local and remote
- **Upload-only sync** - Local changes are pushed to remote, but remote changes are ignored
- **Download-only sync** - Remote changes are pulled locally, but local changes are not uploaded
- **Mirror sync** - Local directory becomes an exact copy of the remote directory

### File filtering
- **Include/exclude patterns** - Use glob patterns to specify which files to sync
- **File size limits** - Set maximum file sizes for synchronization
- **File type restrictions** - Limit sync to specific file extensions
- **Hidden file handling** - Choose whether to sync hidden files and system files

### Conflict resolution strategies
- **Manual resolution** - Prompt user to choose which version to keep
- **Latest wins** - Automatically use the most recently modified version
- **Local wins** - Always prefer the local version during conflicts
- **Remote wins** - Always prefer the remote version during conflicts

## What are custom sync rules?

Custom sync rules allow you to define sophisticated logic for how files are synchronized based on various criteria:

### File-based rules
- **Path matching** - Apply rules based on file paths using wildcards and regex patterns
- **Extension filtering** - Target specific file types for different sync behaviors
- **Size thresholds** - Handle large files differently than small files
- **Date-based rules** - Sync files based on creation or modification dates

### Content-based rules
- **Metadata filtering** - Use file metadata to determine sync behavior
- **Content scanning** - Apply rules based on file content analysis
- **Checksum validation** - Ensure file integrity during synchronization
- **Version detection** - Handle versioned files with custom logic

### Advanced rule conditions
- **Conditional logic** - Combine multiple criteria with AND/OR operators
- **Time-based triggers** - Execute rules at specific times or intervals
- **User context** - Apply different rules based on the current user
- **System state** - Modify behavior based on network conditions or system resources

### Rule priority and inheritance
- **Rule ordering** - Define execution priority for overlapping rules
- **Inheritance patterns** - Apply parent directory rules to subdirectories
- **Override mechanisms** - Allow specific rules to override general ones
- **Conflict resolution** - Handle situations where multiple rules apply

## How can I create custom integrations?

Cirrus Sync provides multiple integration points to extend functionality and connect with external systems:

### API integrations
- **REST API endpoints** - Full programmatic access to sync operations and configuration
- **Webhook notifications** - Real-time events for sync status changes and file operations
- **GraphQL interface** - Flexible querying for complex data relationships
- **Batch operations** - Efficient handling of bulk sync operations

### Plugin architecture
- **Pre-sync hooks** - Execute custom logic before synchronization begins
- **Post-sync hooks** - Perform actions after sync completion
- **File processors** - Transform files during the sync process
- **Custom providers** - Add support for additional cloud storage services

### Event-driven customization
- **File change events** - React to specific file modifications or additions
- **Sync lifecycle events** - Hook into different phases of the synchronization process
- **Error handling events** - Custom logic for handling sync failures and retries
- **User interaction events** - Respond to user actions and preferences

### Configuration examples

**Custom webhook integration:**
```json
{
  "webhooks": {
    "syncComplete": "https://your-app.com/api/sync-complete",
    "syncError": "https://your-app.com/api/sync-error",
    "fileConflict": "https://your-app.com/api/file-conflict"
  }
}
```

**Plugin configuration:**
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "imageProcessor": {
      "enabled": true,
      "resizeImages": true,
      "maxWidth": 1920,
      "quality": 85
    },
    "documentConverter": {
      "enabled": true,
      "convertToPDF": ["docx", "odt"],
      "preserveOriginal": true
    }
  }
}
```

## What performance optimizations are available?

Cirrus Sync offers several performance optimization options to ensure efficient synchronization:

### Bandwidth management
- **Upload/download limits** - Set maximum bandwidth usage for sync operations
- **Adaptive throttling** - Automatically adjust sync speed based on network conditions
- **Priority queuing** - Prioritize certain files or operations over others
- **Scheduled syncing** - Perform intensive sync operations during off-peak hours

### Caching strategies
- **Local metadata cache** - Store file information locally to reduce API calls
- **Content-based deduplication** - Avoid uploading identical files multiple times
- **Delta synchronization** - Only sync changed portions of files when possible
- **Predictive prefetching** - Pre-download files likely to be accessed soon

### Parallel processing
- **Concurrent transfers** - Upload/download multiple files simultaneously
- **Thread pool optimization** - Efficiently manage system resources
- **Batch operations** - Group small operations for better efficiency
- **Asynchronous processing** - Non-blocking operations for better responsiveness

### Storage optimization
- **Compression algorithms** - Reduce file sizes during transfer
- **Smart chunking** - Break large files into optimal-sized pieces
- **Temporary file management** - Efficiently handle intermediate files
- **Cleanup automation** - Remove unnecessary temporary and cache files

## Database fields and data types

Database fields (columns) store different types of data, each with specific characteristics and use cases:

### Numeric types

**Integer Types**
- `TINYINT` - Small integers (-128 to 127)
- `SMALLINT` - Small integers (-32,768 to 32,767)
- `INT` - Standard integers (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
- `BIGINT` - Large integers (very large range)

**Decimal Types**
- `DECIMAL(p,s)` - Fixed-point numbers with precision and scale
- `NUMERIC(p,s)` - Similar to DECIMAL, exact numeric values
- `FLOAT` - Floating-point numbers (approximate)
- `DOUBLE` - Double-precision floating-point numbers

### String types

**Fixed-Length Strings**
- `CHAR(n)` - Fixed-length character strings
- Always uses the specified number of characters
- Padded with spaces if shorter than defined length

**Variable-Length Strings**
- `VARCHAR(n)` - Variable-length character strings
- Uses only the space needed for actual content
- Maximum length specified by n

**Text Types**
- `TEXT` - Large amounts of text data
- `LONGTEXT` - Very large text fields
- `CLOB` - Character Large Objects

### Date and time types

- `DATE` - Date values (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `TIME` - Time values (HH:MM:SS)
- `DATETIME` - Combined date and time
- `TIMESTAMP` - Date and time with timezone information
- `YEAR` - Year values (2-digit or 4-digit)

### Boolean types

- `BOOLEAN` - True/false values
- `BIT` - Single bit values (0 or 1)
- Often implemented as TINYINT(1) in some databases

### Binary types

- `BINARY(n)` - Fixed-length binary data
- `VARBINARY(n)` - Variable-length binary data
- `BLOB` - Binary Large Objects for files, images, etc.

### JSON and XML types

- `XML` - Extensible Markup Language data
- Support for structured document storage and querying

### Specialized types

**UUID/GUID**
- Universally Unique Identifiers
- 128-bit values for unique record identification

**Enum**
- Predefined list of allowed values
- Ensures data consistency for categorical data

**Array Types**
- Store multiple values in a single field
- Supported by some modern databases like PostgreSQL

### Field constraints

**NOT NULL**
- Prevents empty values in the field
- Ensures data completeness

**UNIQUE**
- Ensures all values in the field are different
- Prevents duplicate entries

**DEFAULT**
- Provides automatic value when none is specified
- Simplifies data insertion

**CHECK**
- Validates data against custom conditions
- Enforces business rules at the database level

## Best practices for database design

### Choose appropriate data types
- Use the smallest data type that can accommodate your data
- Consider future growth when sizing fields
- Use appropriate precision for numeric data
- Choose between fixed and variable-length strings based on usage patterns

### Implement proper indexing
- Create indexes on frequently queried columns
- Use composite indexes for multi-column queries
- Monitor and maintain index performance
- Avoid over-indexing which can slow down write operations

### Maintain referential integrity
- Use foreign key constraints to enforce relationships
- Implement cascade rules for related data updates
- Design clear primary key strategies
- Consider using UUIDs for distributed systems

### Plan for scalability
- Design schemas that can grow with your application
- Consider partitioning strategies for large tables
- Plan for read replicas and load distribution
- Design with caching strategies in mind

Understanding these database fundamentals provides the foundation for building robust, scalable applications with efficient data management and retrieval capabilities.
