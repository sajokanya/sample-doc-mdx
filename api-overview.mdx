import AuthExample from '/snippets/auth-example.mdx';

## Getting Started

Our API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing users, authentication, and webhooks. All endpoints are documented using OpenAPI 3.1 specification and include **interactive API playground** functionality.

<Info>
**ðŸŽ® API Playground Available!** 
Each endpoint page includes an interactive playground where you can test API calls directly from the documentation.
</Info>

## Interactive API Playground

The API playground allows you to:

- **Test endpoints in real-time** - Make actual API calls from the documentation
- **Try different parameters** - Experiment with query parameters, request bodies, and headers
- **See live responses** - View actual API responses with proper formatting
- **Authentication testing** - Test with different authentication methods
- **Multiple environments** - Switch between production, staging, and development servers

### How to Use the Playground

1. **Navigate to any endpoint** - Click on any API endpoint in the navigation
2. **Configure parameters** - Fill in required and optional parameters
3. **Set authentication** - Add your API key or JWT token
4. **Select server** - Choose between production, staging, or development
5. **Send request** - Click the "Send" button to make the API call
6. **Review response** - Examine the response data, headers, and status codes

<Warning>
**Using Production Server**: Be careful when testing with the production server. Use test data and avoid making destructive operations.
</Warning>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Authentication

Our API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your JWT token in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here
```

### Getting a Token

Use the `/auth/login` endpoint to obtain a JWT token:

<AuthExample />

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Authenticated requests**: 1000 requests per hour
- **Unauthenticated requests**: 100 requests per hour

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Request limit per hour
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets

## Response Format

All API responses use JSON format and follow a consistent structure:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "data": {...},
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human readable error message",
  "details": {...}
}
```

## Webhooks

The API supports webhooks for real-time event notifications. Configure webhook endpoints to receive notifications when:

- Users are created or deleted
- Authentication events occur
- System events happen

## SDKs and Libraries

We provide official SDKs for popular programming languages:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `npm install sample-api-sdk`
- **Python**: `pip install sample-api`
- **Go**: `go get github.com/sample-org/api-go`
