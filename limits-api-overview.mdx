## Key Features

### Workflow Process Management
- **Limits Workflow Process Instance Entities**: Manage workflow process instances
- **Process Record Entities**: Handle process records and their lifecycle
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete operations for all entities

### Pagination Support
All collection endpoints support pagination with the following parameters:
- `page`: Zero-based page index (default: 0)
- `size`: Page size (default: 20, minimum: 1)
- `sort`: Sorting criteria in format `property,(asc|desc)`

- `GET /limits/rest/v2/spring/jpa/limitsWorkflowProcessInstanceEntities/{id}` - Get specific instance
- `PUT /limits/rest/v2/spring/jpa/limitsWorkflowProcessInstanceEntities/{id}` - Update instance
- `PATCH /limits/rest/v2/spring/jpa/limitsWorkflowProcessInstanceEntities/{id}` - Partial update
