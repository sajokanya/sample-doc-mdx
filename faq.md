### How do I transfer my settings to a new computer?

1. Export settings from the old computer: Settings \> Advanced \> Export Configuration
2. Install Cirrus Sync on the new computer
3. Import settings: Settings \> Advanced \> Import Configuration
4. Re-authenticate cloud providers if needed

## Synchronization

### How does real-time sync work?

Real-time sync monitors your local folders for changes using file system events. When a file is modified, created, or deleted, Cirrus Sync immediately starts the synchronization process. This typically takes 1-5 seconds depending on file size and network speed.

### What happens if I modify the same file on two devices?

Cirrus Sync detects conflicts and offers several resolution options:

1. **Manual resolution** - Review and choose which version to keep
2. **Automatic rules** - Newest file wins, largest file wins, etc.
3. **Keep both** - Rename one version to preserve both files

### Can I sync files larger than 100 MB?

Yes, Cirrus Sync supports files up to 50 GB in size. Large files are transferred using chunked uploads for reliability. The actual size limit may depend on your cloud provider's restrictions.

### Why are some files not syncing?

Common reasons files don't sync:

1. **File in use** - Another application has the file locked
2. **Permissions** - Insufficient permissions to read/write the file
3. **Filters** - File type excluded by sync filters
4. **Size limits** - File exceeds maximum size settings
5. **Storage quota** - Cloud provider storage full
6. **Network issues** - Temporary connectivity problems

Check the sync status panel for specific error messages.

### How can I exclude certain files from syncing?

Configure sync filters in each sync folder's settings:

1. Right-click sync folder \> Settings \> Filters
2. Add patterns to exclude:
   - `*.tmp` - Exclude temporary files
   - `node_modules/` - Exclude specific folders
   - `*.log` - Exclude log files
3. Use include patterns to sync only specific file types
4. Test filters with the preview option

## Performance and storage

### How much bandwidth does Cirrus Sync use?

Bandwidth usage depends on:

- Number and size of files being synced
- Sync frequency settings
- Whether compression is enabled
- Network connection quality

You can limit bandwidth usage in Settings \> Network \> Bandwidth Controls.

### Does Cirrus Sync work offline?

Cirrus Sync requires an internet connection for synchronization. However, it offers offline features:

- **Offline access** - Mark files for offline availability
- **Local cache** - Recently accessed files remain available
- **Queue operations** - Changes are queued and sync when online
- **Conflict detection** - Handles changes made while offline

### How much local storage does Cirrus Sync use?

Storage usage includes:

- **Application files** - ~200 MB
- **Local cache** - Configurable (default 5 GB)
- **Sync folders** - Size of synchronized files
- **Metadata database** - Usually under 100 MB

Use Smart Sync to reduce local storage by keeping files in the cloud only.

## Troubleshooting

### Cirrus Sync won't start after installation

Try these solutions:

1. **Windows**: Run as Administrator, install Visual C\+\+ Redistributable
2. **macOS**: Grant Full Disk Access in Security & Privacy settings
3. **Linux**: Install required dependencies (see installation guide)
4. Check antivirus software isn't blocking the application
5. Restart your computer

### Sync is very slow

Optimize sync performance:

1. **Check network connection** - Run speed test
2. **Adjust bandwidth limits** - Increase if too restrictive
3. **Enable compression** - Reduces transfer size
4. **Reduce concurrent transfers** - Lower CPU usage
5. **Use wired connection** - More stable than Wi-Fi
6. **Sync during off-peak hours** - Less network congestion

### I'm getting authentication errors

Resolve authentication issues:

1. **Re-enter credentials** - Password may have changed
2. **Clear application cache** - Remove corrupted auth tokens
3. **Check account status** - Ensure account isn't suspended
4. **Verify 2FA codes** - Use current time-based codes
5. **Reset API permissions** - Revoke and re-grant provider access

## Advanced features
