# Quickstart Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through creating your first OLAP cube with Atoti. You'll learn core concepts by building a simple analytics solution with sample data.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [installed Atoti](/installation) and can run Jupyter notebooks.
</Note>

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- Created an Atoti session
- Loaded sample data into tables
- Built an OLAP cube with measures and hierarchies
- Created interactive visualizations
- Performed basic analytics queries

## Step 1: Create Your First Session

Start by importing Atoti and creating a session:

```python
import atoti as tt
import pandas as pd

# Create an Atoti session
session = tt.Session()
print(f"Atoti session started at: {session.url}")
```

The session is your main entry point to Atoti. It manages your data, cubes, and provides the web interface for visualizations.

## Step 2: Prepare Sample Data

Let's create some sample sales data to work with:

```python
# Create sample sales data
sales_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=100, freq='D'),
    'product': ['Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C'] * 34,
    'region': ['North', 'South', 'East', 'West'] * 25,
    'sales_amount': [100, 150, 200, 120, 180] * 20,
    'quantity': [10, 15, 20, 12, 18] * 20
})

# Display the first few rows
print(sales_data.head())
```

## Step 3: Load Data into Atoti

<Warning>
The following code examples use conceptual API patterns. Always verify exact method names and parameters against the [official Atoti documentation](https://docs.activeviam.com/products/atoti/python-sdk/latest/).
</Warning>

```python
# Create a table in Atoti and load the data
# Note: Verify exact method names in official documentation
sales_table = session.read_pandas(
    sales_data,
    table_name="sales"
)

# Verify the table was created
print(f"Table created with {len(sales_table)} rows")
```

## Step 4: Create Your First Cube

Now let's create an OLAP cube from our data:

```python
# Create a cube from the sales table
# Note: Verify exact syntax in official documentation
cube = session.create_cube(sales_table)

# The cube automatically creates basic measures and hierarchies
print("Cube created successfully!")
```

## Step 5: Explore Basic Measures

Atoti automatically creates measures from numeric columns:

```python
# List available measures
# Note: Verify exact method names in official documentation
measures = cube.measures
print("Available measures:")
for measure_name in measures:
    print(f"  - {measure_name}")
```

## Step 6: Create Custom Measures

You can create custom calculated measures:

```python
# Example: Create an average sales amount measure
# Note: Verify exact syntax in official documentation
cube.measures["Average Sales"] = cube.measures["sales_amount"] / cube.measures["quantity"]

print("Custom measure 'Average Sales' created")
```

## Step 7: Explore Hierarchies

Hierarchies allow you to slice and dice your data:

```python
# List available hierarchies
# Note: Verify exact method names in official documentation
hierarchies = cube.hierarchies
print("Available hierarchies:")
for hierarchy_name in hierarchies:
    print(f"  - {hierarchy_name}")
```

## Step 8: Query Your Cube

Perform basic queries on your cube:

```python
# Create a simple query
# Note: Verify exact syntax in official documentation
query = cube.query(
    measures=["sales_amount", "quantity"],
    include_totals=True
)

# Display results
print("Query results:")
print(query.head())
```

## Step 9: Create Visualizations

<Note>
Atoti provides built-in widgets for Jupyter notebooks. The exact widget names and parameters should be verified in the official documentation.
</Note>

```python
# Create a simple chart widget
# Note: Verify exact widget names and syntax in official documentation
import atoti.widgets as widgets

# Create a bar chart
chart = widgets.bar_chart(
    cube=cube,
    measures=["sales_amount"],
    rows=["product"]
)

# Display the chart
chart
```

## Step 10: Access the Web Interface

Atoti provides a web-based interface for advanced analytics:

```python
# Open the web interface
print(f"Access the Atoti web interface at: {session.url}")

# The web interface provides:
# - Interactive pivot tables
# - Advanced charting capabilities
# - Dashboard creation tools
# - Collaborative features
```

## Key Concepts Learned

### Session
- Entry point to Atoti
- Manages data, cubes, and web interface
- Provides connection to the analytics engine

### Tables
- Store your source data
- Can be loaded from various sources (Pandas, CSV, databases)
- Form the foundation for cube creation

### Cubes
- OLAP cubes for multidimensional analysis
- Automatically generate measures and hierarchies
- Support complex calculations and aggregations

### Measures
- Numeric values that can be aggregated
- Include automatic measures (SUM, COUNT) and custom calculations
- Form the "facts" in your analysis

### Hierarchies
- Dimensional structures for slicing data
- Allow drill-down and roll-up operations
- Provide the "dimensions" for analysis
