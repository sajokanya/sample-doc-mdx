# What is a database

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by database management systems (DBMS), which provide the interface between users and the database.

## Key characteristics

Databases have several important characteristics that make them essential for modern applications:

- **Structured storage**: Data is organized in tables, rows, and columns for efficient retrieval
- **Data integrity**: Built-in mechanisms ensure data accuracy and consistency
- **Concurrent access**: Multiple users can access and modify data simultaneously
- **Security**: Access controls protect sensitive information
- **Backup and recovery**: Systems to prevent data loss and restore information

## Types of databases

### Relational databases
Store data in tables with relationships between them. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

### NoSQL databases
Handle unstructured or semi-structured data. Categories include:
- Document databases (MongoDB)
- Key-value stores (Redis)
- Column-family (Cassandra)
- Graph databases (Neo4j)

## Database operations

Common operations performed on databases include:

- **Create**: Adding new data records
- **Read**: Retrieving existing data
- **Update**: Modifying existing records
- **Delete**: Removing data records

These operations are often referred to as CRUD operations.

## Why databases matter

Databases are fundamental to most software applications because they:

- Provide persistent data storage
- Enable efficient data retrieval and manipulation
- Support data relationships and constraints
- Offer scalability for growing data needs
- Ensure data consistency across applications
